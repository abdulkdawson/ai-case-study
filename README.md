**Octopus Data Inc.(2016)**

[Website](https://www.octoparse.com/)

Founded in 2012 by co-founders Keven Liu and Jerry Huang in Walnut Creek, California. 
Its staff is between 51 and 200, and its current headquarters are in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Octopus Data Inc. is a software company that collects data from static and dynamic websites. Their product, Octoparse, is a visual web data extraction software that simulates human operation to interact with web pages. You can use the point-&-click UI to easily bulk extract web data from web pages (including those using Ajax, JS, etc.), and there are various export formats of your choice like CSV, Excel, HTML, TXT, and database ([MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/)). Octoparse’s cloud service (available in paid editions) can extract and store large amounts of data to meet large-scale extraction needs.

The company is Venture Capital-Backed in the later stage (Series B)	with its most recent funding amount of $15.4M	coming on March 15, 2021.

##Business Activities

According to Octoparse, their target customers are eCommerce business owners, researchers, and marketers. From Price monitoring in E-commerce to scraping search results for paper research, and Lead generation are just a few examples of how data scraping is used in some industries. The process of scraping data from web pages can, however, not always be smooth. You might face many challenges while extracting data, such as IP blocking and CAPTCHA. Platform owners use such methods for anti-web-scraping, which can hinder you from getting data. 

Octoparse offers code-free data extraction so unlike the majority of its competitors, Octoparse does not require prior technical knowledge. It also allows you to scrape data with modern visual design and automatically scrapes the data from the website(s) along with the SaaS Web-Data platform feature. It is unclear if Octoparse possesses any unfair advantages. 

>"Octoparse enables you to scrape these websites by rotating anonymous HTTP proxy servers. In Cloud Extraction, Octoparse applies lots of 3rd party proxies for automatic IP rotation. For Local Extraction, you can add a list of external proxy addresses manually and configure them for automatic rotation."

## Landscape 

Octoparse is a major player in the web scraping software market, which is a part of the data engineering industry. Over the past decade, various innovations and trends have contributed to the growth of data engineering. Ten years ago, there was a need for enhanced analytical abilities, which required better data management and processing. Companies had to invest significantly to provide data scientists with the necessary data and processing capabilities. This led to the emergence of open-source software frameworks like Hadoop. Later, cloud data warehouses (CDWs) like Amazon Redshift became popular and widely adopted. Today, companies like [Meta](https://www.meta.com/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com/) are leading the way in data engineering.

Big data has become a fast-growing trend in today’s economy, and the demand for data extraction tools like Octoparse is only increasing.

### Customer Reviews
>*"Very user-friendly design. I can create the scraper for any website I want and design every detail based on my requirements.*" #1f6feb

## Recommendations

The company should consider making the product suitable for all environment use cases, such as MacOS and Linux. You can download the scrapper to Mac but according to Octoparse users 
the cloud-based software does not perform as it does on a Windows machine. This solution could have a huge impact on the business due to that fact that there will be less limitation for users who work in non-Windows environments.

Octoparse is a great solution for those looking to scrap data but have little to no coding experience. I would recommend doing your research because several Web-scrapping manufactures offer similar products at a lower cost.
