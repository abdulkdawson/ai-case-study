**Octopus Data Inc.(2016)**

Founded in 2016 by co-founders Keven Liu and Jerry Huang in Walnut Creek, California. 
Its staff is between 51 and 200, and its current headquarters are in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Octopus Data Inc. is a software company that collects data from static and dynamic websites. Their product, Octoparse, is a visual web data extraction software that simulates human operation to interact with web pages. You can use the point-&-click UI to easily bulk extract web data from web pages (including those using Ajax, JS, etc.), and there are various export formats of your choice like CSV, Excel, HTML, TXT, and database (MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle). Octoparse’s cloud service (available in paid editions) can extract and store large amounts of data to meet large-scale extraction needs.

The company is Venture Capital-Backed in the later stage (Series B)	with its most recent funding amount of $15.4M	coming on March 15, 2021.

## Business Activities

The process of scraping data from web pages can, however, not always be smooth. You might face many challenges while extracting data, such as IP blocking and CAPTCHA. Platform owners use such methods for anti-web-scraping, which can hinder you from getting data. 

According to Octoparse, their target customers are eCommerce business owners, researchers, and marketers. From Price monitoring in E-commerce to scraping search results for paper research, and Lead generation are just a few examples of how data scraping is used in some industries.

Octoparse offers code-free data extraction so unlike the majority of its competitors, Octoparse does not require prior technical knowledge. It also allows you to scrape data with modern visual design and automatically scrapes the data from the website(s) along with the SaaS Web-Data platform feature. It us unclear if Octoparse possesses any unfair advantages.
